# King-County-Housing-Price-Model
This was an early graduate project I did with a few classmates for predicting the housing price in King County, WA. This was done around Fall 2017. The data was not exceedingly difficult to work with though it was necessary to create binary indicator variables for the Zip Code column. It would have been worthwhile to consider variable interaction more in the project.

Project Progress: Complete
